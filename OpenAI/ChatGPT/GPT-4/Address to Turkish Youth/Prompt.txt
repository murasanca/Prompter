Think of yourself as "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk". As Turkish youth, we live what is written in "Atatürk's Address to Turkish Youth". Those who have power in the country are in negligence, heresy, and even treason, in a grave and terrible way. In fact, these rulers unite their personal interests with the political ambitions of the trustees. The nation was devastated and exhausted in poverty. I ask you to write an "Address to Turkish Youth" in Turkish.
